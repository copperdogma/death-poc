HomeKit 4-Mode Discrete Control – Solutions and Analysis

Top 3 Solutions
	1.	Thermostat/HVAC Mode Service – Present the device as a thermostat or HVAC accessory with four modes (Off, Heat, Cool, Auto). HomeKit will show a segmented control for these discrete states.
	2.	Security System (Alarm) Service – Emulate a security system accessory with four arming states (Off/Disarmed, Home, Away, Night). This provides multiple discrete buttons in HomeKit’s UI (similar to alarm panels).
	3.	Slider-Based Mode Control (Fan/Light Hack) – Use a supported dimmable accessory (e.g. a fan or light with brightness) and map specific slider ranges to each mode. By setting coarse steps, the slider effectively acts as a 4-position selector.

Detailed Analysis

Solution 1: Thermostat/HVAC Mode Service
	•	How it Works: Implement the Matter Thermostat (HVAC) cluster or Heater/Cooler service on the ESP32. Expose a Target Heating/Cooling State characteristic with values for Off (0), Heat (1), Cool (2), and Auto (3). These four enumerated values can be repurposed as the 4 modes (e.g. Off = Closed, Heat = “Little Kid”, Cool = “Big Kid”, Auto = “Take One”). The device would ignore actual temperature control and instead use the mode selection to drive its behavior.
	•	HomeKit Support: HomeKit fully supports thermostats and HVAC accessories via Matter. The Apple Home app will recognize the device as a thermostat/air-conditioner and present a mode selector UI. In HomeKit, a thermostat’s target mode supports four states: Off, Heat, Cool, and Auto ￼. Users can switch among these modes using a segmented control or menu in the Home app. This is an official, native UI (no fallback to “Outlet”). For example, HomeKit thermostats like Ecobee or Honeywell have exactly these discrete modes available ￼.
	•	Pros:
	•	Provides exactly four discrete options in the Home app UI, matching the requirement.
	•	Native HomeKit behavior – the Home app will show an appropriate control (no custom app needed). The modes are presented as clear options (Off/Heat/Cool/Auto) rather than a continuous slider.
	•	Fully Matter-compatible – Thermostats/air conditioners are in Apple’s supported Matter categories ￼, so no “unsupported” fallback.
	•	Reliable and tested with many devices (thermostat integration is a well-trodden path in HomeKit).
	•	Cons:
	•	Fixed Mode Labels: The Home app will label the modes as “Off, Heat, Cool, Auto.” These cannot be changed to custom names. Users must remember the mapping (e.g. treat “Heat” as “Little Kid mode,” etc.), which could be unintuitive. This is a trade-off for using a standard service – HomeKit does not allow custom text for mode names.
	•	Temperature-Centric UI: The thermostat interface in HomeKit is designed around temperature control. The accessory will appear with a temperature readout and possibly a thermostat dial. If the device isn’t actually measuring or setting temperature, this UI is somewhat extraneous. In fact, HomeKit expects a temperature sensor reading for HVAC devices, and without one it may display 0.0° as current temperature ￼. This might confuse users or require adding a dummy sensor value to the firmware to make the UI cleaner.
	•	Potential Overhead: Implementing a full thermostat cluster means handling characteristics like current temperature, target temperature, etc. You can fix these values or update them arbitrarily, but it’s additional implementation work for a non-thermostat device. The mode selection (system mode) itself is straightforward, but ensuring HomeKit is satisfied (e.g. providing a dummy temperature so the app doesn’t show an error) adds complexity ￼.
	•	Implementation Complexity: Medium. ESP-Matter already supports standard clusters like Thermostat, so leveraging that is feasible. Espressif’s SDK or examples likely have an HVAC device template. You’ll need to map the four mode values to your device’s functionality, which is simple logic. The harder part is dealing with the extra characteristics a thermostat brings – for example, you might need to supply a fake current temperature or handle HomeKit’s expectation of a temperature unit. Configuration is more involved than a basic on/off switch, but it’s within reach for an experienced developer. No custom HomeKit coding is required beyond using the standard cluster (hence staying within official support). Overall, it’s a moderate effort to repurpose a thermostat service for mode selection, but it scores high on reliability and UI integration.

Solution 2: Security System (Alarm) Service
	•	How it Works: Represent the device as a HomeKit Security System accessory. Security systems in HomeKit have multiple discrete states: typically Off (Disarmed) and various Arm modes. HomeKit supports up to four modes on security systems – commonly Disarmed, Arm Home (Stay), Arm Away, Arm Night ￼. By implementing the equivalent in your device (if using HomeKit Accessory Protocol directly), you could map the four desired modes to these states (e.g. Disarmed = Closed, Home = “Little Kid”, Away = “Big Kid”, Night = “Take One”). The Home app would then show a security system tile where the user can tap one of four buttons to set the state.
	•	HomeKit Support: Natively, the Home app provides a specialized interface for security systems. Users see an alarm panel UI with the named modes (including icons for Home, Away, Night, etc.). Many real-world HomeKit devices use this: for example, the Aqara Hub in security system mode exposes Disabled (Off), Home, Away, Night options ￼. This is very close to the ideal UX for discrete mode selection (the user taps the mode name to activate it). However, this device type is not currently available through Matter. Apple’s supported Matter accessory list does not include security systems or alarm panels ￼. In other words, if you try to expose a Matter device with a “security system” cluster (currently Matter has no such cluster in 1.0/1.1), the Home app will either ignore it or show it as an unsupported accessory (likely defaulting to a switch or nothing at all). HomeKit only supports security systems via the native HomeKit protocol (HAP) or possibly a future Matter update if one is defined.
	•	Pros:
	•	Ideal UI for Modes: The Home app’s security system control is essentially a set of discrete mode buttons, exactly matching the need for 4 selectable states. There’s no slider or percentage – just distinct labels. This makes it very intuitive for a user to switch modes.
	•	Labels Are Semi-Generic: While you can’t customize the labels “Home/Away/Night/Off” in the Home app, they are abstract enough that a user might remember their custom meaning (e.g. maybe “Away” corresponds to a certain mode on the candy dispenser). In fact, using “Off” for Closed fits naturally. It’s arguably easier to repurpose these terms than something like “Heat/Cool”.
	•	Multi-control Display: The security system tile in HomeKit displays the current mode at a glance (with an icon) and allows quick toggling. It won’t be conflated with brightness or other features. It’s a single, consolidated control for mode.
	•	Cons:
	•	Not Supported via Matter: The biggest drawback is that you cannot achieve this through Matter at the moment. Apple has not enabled any Matter-to-HomeKit mapping for security systems yet ￼. That means pursuing this solution would force you outside the standard Matter path. You would need to either implement HomeKit Accessory Protocol (HAP) directly on the device (bypassing Matter), or use a bridge (like Homebridge or another hub) to translate a Matter “mode” into a HAP security service. Both approaches increase complexity significantly and go against the “Matter-first” goal.
	•	HAP Implementation Challenges: Working with HAP natively on an ESP32-C3 means dealing with Apple’s certification (MFi Program) if this is a commercial product, or using an open-source HomeKit library (like ESP-HomeKit or Apple’s ADK) for a DIY project. This is non-trivial. It involves different SDKs and compliance with Apple’s requirements. Essentially, it abandons the simplicity of Matter’s interoperability.
	•	Possible Future Matter Support: It’s possible that a future Matter spec (or Apple’s extensions) will include an alarm device type, but there’s no guarantee on timeline. Relying on an unsupported feature means potential risk – your solution might not work at all until some undefined point in the future (if ever).
	•	Label Semantics: Although the standard labels are generic, they still might not perfectly map to your use-case (“Night” vs “Take One” mode, for example, are unrelated concepts). This could cause user confusion unless clearly documented. There is no way to change these labels in the Home UI.
	•	Implementation Complexity: Hard. This solution is the most complex because it steps outside Matter’s supported feature set. If you choose to implement the HAP Security System service on the ESP32, you’ll essentially be writing a custom HomeKit integration. This requires significant effort and knowledge of Apple’s HAP protocol. If you instead attempt a workaround (for example, a Matter bridge that presents a virtual HomeKit alarm), you’d need an always-on bridge device (like a Homebridge instance on a Raspberry Pi) – which reintroduces exactly the extra hub that Matter was supposed to eliminate. In short, achieving a 4-mode security accessory without native Matter support is an uphill battle. The development and maintenance cost is high, and it’s only justified if the perfect UI is absolutely critical and other solutions are insufficient. In most cases, this would be considered overkill given simpler alternatives.

Solution 3: Slider-Based Mode Control (Fan/Light Hack)
	•	How it Works: This approach “reuses” an existing HomeKit control that uses a continuous value and constrains it to act like a discrete selector. For example, you could expose the device as a Fan accessory with a Rotation Speed characteristic, or as a Dimmable Light with Brightness. HomeKit will show a slider for these types. In your firmware, you map specific slider percentages to the four modes. For instance: 0% = Closed, 33% = Little Kid, 66% = Big Kid, 100% = Take One (you could also use 25% increments, etc.). If possible, you set the characteristic’s step size to enforce only those values. The user would then change the slider and the device would internally switch to the corresponding mode.
	•	HomeKit Support: Lights, fans, and similar are fully supported in Matter and HomeKit ￼. In fact, this method has been used in the community for devices that have multiple modes but no native HomeKit representation. One example is a robot vacuum cleaner exposed to HomeKit via Homebridge: developers have used a fan service where different “fan speed” percentages trigger vacuum modes (e.g. 0% = off/dock, 50% = normal clean, 100% = turbo mode) ￼. The Home app doesn’t know these percentages are modes – it just thinks it’s a fan speed – but the mapping is handled behind the scenes. This means the solution is 100% Matter-compliant and will not appear as an outlet (it will appear as whatever service you choose, like a fan icon or light bulb). It works within HomeKit’s normal UI, albeit in a non-traditional way.
	•	Pros:
	•	Uses Standard Types: There is zero risk of “unsupported accessory” here. You would be using something like a Light, Outlet, or Fan service which Apple unquestionably supports ￼. This guarantees the device shows up reliably in the Home app.
	•	Simple Implementation: Mapping mode values to a slider is conceptually simple. You set up an On/Off + Brightness light or an Active + RotationSpeed fan in Matter (both of which ESP-Matter supports out-of-the-box). Then in the device logic, on brightness/speed change events, you round the value to the nearest mode threshold and activate that mode. This doesn’t require any exotic firmware work – just some if/else logic. You can also advertise a minStep value for the slider (e.g. 33% steps), so the Home app UI slider will snap in coarse increments. For example, HomeKit sliders can reflect step values, often showing only a few stops (one user noted HomeKit’s fan slider with certain configurations gave 33%, 66%, 100% steps by default ￼). This helps approximate discrete selections.
	•	No Extra UI clutter: Unlike the thermostat approach, a fan or light won’t show irrelevant temperature controls. It will simply have a slider (and possibly an on/off switch). The interface is cleaner in that sense, and you could choose whichever icon fits better (a fan icon or light bulb – neither is perfect for “candy modes”, but at least it’s something neutral).
	•	Cons:
	•	Not Truly Discrete UI: The Home app will still display this as a continuous slider control, which is not as user-friendly for distinct modes. There are no textual labels on the slider indicating mode names. The user must infer or remember which slider position corresponds to which mode. This is a significant UX compromise – it’s easy for a user (or a guest) to set an in-between value that doesn’t exactly match a mode, potentially resulting in the device picking the nearest mode arbitrarily. Even if you set coarse steps, the slider may still show intermediate values during dragging. In short, it’s not obvious that there are four specific states ￼.
	•	Limited Feedback: HomeKit’s UI will display a percentage or fan level, not the mode name. For example, it might say “Fan – 66%” rather than “Big Kid Mode.” There’s no native way to make it show a custom mode label. This again relies on the user’s memory or perhaps external labeling (you could rename the accessory to hint at the current mode, but HomeKit won’t dynamically rename it per mode).
	•	Potential for Error: If the Home app or Siri sets a slightly off value (say 34% instead of 33%), your firmware mapping would need to decide (likely treat it as 33%). This is manageable, but slight mismatches could happen. Voice control via Siri like “set fan to 50%” would not correspond to a defined mode unless you handle it. Essentially you’re working against the grain of how HomeKit expects the control to be used.
	•	Aesthetic Mismatch: The accessory will be identified as a Light or Fan (with a lightbulb or fan icon). This might be okay, but it’s semantically odd for something like a candy dispenser or other non-fan device. It could confuse users of the Home app who expect a fan slider to actually control a fan. There’s no way to change the icon other than picking a different device category (e.g. you could also present it as a “Ventilation Fan” or “Air Purifier” – those also have speed controls – but the same slider concept applies).
	•	Implementation Complexity: Easy–Medium. Technically, this is perhaps the easiest solution to implement. ESP-Matter has examples for lights and fans, so you can base your code on those. Defining a brightness or speed characteristic with a specific step increment is straightforward (just set the metadata in the Matter device definition). The main logic is a small lookup table for ranges to modes, which is trivial. The complexity is more on the user education side – you must clearly instruct the user how to use the slider to pick modes. If this is a personal project, that’s fine; if it’s a product, you’d need to document the mapping in the app or manual. From a coding perspective, you avoid dealing with multiple services or multi-state characteristics. Essentially you’re piggybacking on a well-supported characteristic (percentage) and restricting its usage. In summary, implementation is relatively low-effort, but achieving a good user experience is the challenging part. It’s a bit of a hack, trading UI elegance for simplicity of development ￼.

Recommendation

After analyzing the options, the best solution for a robust 4-mode control in HomeKit is to use the Thermostat/HVAC mode approach (Solution 1). This strikes the best balance between HomeKit compatibility and user-friendly discrete control:
	•	Justification: The thermostat-style service gives you four true discrete states (no awkward sliders) and is fully supported by Apple’s Matter integration ￼. Unlike the security system idea, it works today with standard Matter – no custom bridging or uncertified workarounds needed. Compared to the slider hack, it provides a clearer UI (the Home app will show distinct mode buttons or a segmented control for Off/Heat/Cool/Auto). Although the labels aren’t custom, they at least indicate separate modes rather than a nebulous percentage. Reliability-wise, thermostats are a core part of HomeKit’s device types, so you can expect stable behavior and Siri support (e.g. “set device to cool mode” might even be understood, whereas Siri won’t know what  “50%” means in context).
	•	Implementation Strategy: You should implement a Matter thermostat server on the ESP32-C3. In the ESP-Matter SDK, look for a Thermostat example or HVAC device profile – this will include the System Mode (sometimes called thermostat-systemmode or similar) which corresponds to Off/Heat/Cool/Auto. Configure your device to support exactly those four modes. You can hard-code certain aspects: for instance, if temperature control is irrelevant, set a fixed default target temperature and report a dummy current temperature (to satisfy HomeKit’s UI expectations ￼). Essentially, you’ll use the mode selection as the main functional interface and treat the temperature fields as placeholders. It would be wise to set the Current Temperature to a reasonable value (or even better, if the device is in a room with a HomePod or thermostat, you might read that via Matter or some other sensor if available, but that’s optional). The key part is ensuring the Target Mode characteristic changes trigger your internal mode logic: map 0=Closed, 1=Little Kid, 2=Big Kid, 3=Take One, and handle these in your firmware. Also, advertise support for all four modes so HomeKit displays them. Test this thoroughly in the Apple Home app – when you switch modes, does the device react accordingly? Does the Home app UI update the state correctly? Fine-tune any additional thermostat settings (for example, you might disable “Auto” if you wanted exactly 3 modes, but in your case you need four, so keep Auto as one mode).
	•	User Experience Mitigation: Since you can’t rename “Heat/Cool/Auto” in HomeKit, consider educating the user or leveraging Siri Shortcuts for a friendlier experience. For instance, you can create HomeKit Scenes or Shortcuts named “Little Kid Mode” that simply set the thermostat to “Heat” internally. This way, the end-user can activate modes by name via Siri or a tap, without worrying about the underlying label. In the Home app, the device will still show the HVAC terms, but users might rarely need to manually toggle it if you provide convenient scenes. This isn’t strictly necessary, but it can reduce confusion.
	•	Risk Assessment: Overall, this solution has a high likelihood of working reliably. The main risks are user confusion due to the misaligned labels and the presence of a temperature readout in the UI. These are not functional failures, just UX issues. Technically, the risk of HomeKit “falling back” or not recognizing the device is very low – Apple explicitly supports thermostats in Matter ￼. To mitigate any UI weirdness, you should test on the latest iOS version (as of 2025) and possibly iPad/Mac to see how the Home app presents the device. Ensure that the device category is correctly identified as Thermostat or Air Conditioner (so that HomeKit knows to show the mode picker). Another minor risk is the added complexity in your firmware – but since you won’t actually drive any HVAC hardware, the scope is limited to mode management. In summary, the benefits outweigh the drawbacks: you get a clean 4-button selection in HomeKit with no hacks, which meets all the success criteria except custom naming. Given the constraints, this is the most practical and user-friendly path.

In conclusion, using a thermostat/AC accessory type for a 4-mode Matter device is the recommended solution. It adheres to official HomeKit support and delivers a mostly intuitive experience. The device will be recognized as a proper accessory (not a generic outlet), and the modes can be selected discretely. While no solution can display arbitrary custom mode names in Apple’s Home app, this approach provides a solid compromise that fulfills the functional needs. By carefully implementing and documenting the mode mapping (e.g. in your product app or notes, state “Heat = Little Kid Mode”, etc.), you’ll achieve a reliable and Matter-compliant 4-mode control in HomeKit.
